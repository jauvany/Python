print(4**5)

Flight Time

#02
You need to calculate the flight time of an upcoming trip. You are flying from LA to Sydney, covering a distance of 7425 miles, the plane flies at an average speed of 550 miles an hour.

Calculate and output the total flight time in hours.

Hint
The result should be a float.
Use the print statement to output the result.

"""Solution """
print(7425 / 550)


#03
Strings


You are given a code that should output a string with quotes.
However, it contains errors.
print('I'm learning Python. It's easy.')

Task
Fix the given code to generate the expected output.
Remember, you need to escape the quotes in the strings to fix the errors in the code.

"""Solution"""

print('I\'m learning Python. It\'s easy.')

#04
Strings


Write a program to output the letters A B C D, each on a separate line.
You can use 3 quotes to add the new lines.

String Operations


Youâ€™re given a task to write the word "hi" 42 times. Boring, right?

Write a program to do it for you.

Create a program to output "hi" 42 times, without any separators, on the same line.
Remember, you can multiply strings by numbers.

"""Solution"""
#your code goes here
print("hi" * 42)

#06

Input


Somebody wrote code to take a string input and output it, repeated 10 times.
However, the code results in an error.
Fix the code to output the desired output.

Write a program to control entrance to a club.
Only people who are 18 or older are allowed to enter the club.
Your program takes the age of the person who tries to enter, and outputs "Allowed" if they are allowed to enter the club, and "Sorry" if they are younger than the allowed age.

Sample Input
24

Sample Output
Allowed

Tip Calculator


When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But whoâ€™s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you thatâ€™s for sure! Youâ€™re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.

Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a float.

Sample Input
50

Sample Output
10.0

Explanation: 20% of 50 is 10.
To calculate 20% of a given amount, you can multiply the number by 20 and divide it by 100: 50*20/100 = 10.0

"""Solution"""

bill = int(input())
print(bill*20/100)

Write a program that checks if the water is boiling.

if Statements


Write a program that checks if the water is boiling.
Take the integer temperature in Celsius as input and output "Boiling" if the temperature is above or equal to 100.

Sample Input
105

Sample Output
Boiling
Do not output anything if the water is not boiling.

"""Solution"""

temp = int(input())
if temp >= 100:
    print("Boiling")

Boolean Logic


Given the age of a person as an input, output their age group.

Here are the age groups you need to handle:
Child: 0 to 11
Teen: 12 to 17
Adult: 18 to 64

Sample Input
42

Sample Output
Adult
Remember, you can use the Boolean and operator to combine conditions, like x>0 and x<20.

""" Solution """
age = int(input())
if age <= 11:
    print("Child")
elif age > 12 and age < 18:

while Loops


You are given a program that outputs all the numbers from 0 to 10.
Change the code to make it output only the even numbers.
Any integer that can be divided exactly by 2 is an even number.

x = 0
while x<=10:
  if x%2 == 0:
