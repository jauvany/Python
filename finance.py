Inflation

We need to calculate how much an item worth $8000 today will cost after 10 years, if the annual inflation rate is 5%.

Hint: Use the following formula to calculate the future value: present value*(1+inflation rate)**years
Note that the inflation rate should be expressed as a decimal, so 5% corresponds to the value 0.05,

Write a program to calculate and output the result.
Use the formula in the print statement with the given values.

""" SOLUTION """

present_value = 8000
annual_inflation = 1 + 0.05
print(present_value * (annual_inflation) ** 10)
